# v0.13.0

Date: 2025-10-24

## Highlights

- Easier worker assignment: replaced worker-count selects with sliders across the game (production, upgrades and when placing new buildings). This makes assigning many workers faster and more intuitive.
- Improved parcel editor: placing a new object now uses the same slider UI for worker count and shows adjusted build times dynamically.
- Production improvements: production length slider and live preview updated to reflect worker choices and available resources.
- Population & hospitals: clarified help documentation about daily population ticks, hospital capacity and what happens when productions are cancelled due to insufficient workers.
- Scheduled tasks: the daily population tick (births) is registered so population is computed automatically each day; this can still be run manually for testing with `php artisan population:births`.

## Notes for players

- When starting production or upgrades you must explicitly choose the number of workers using the slider; starting with 0 keeps the action disabled.
- "Available" values fall back to English if translations are missing — this avoids showing raw translation keys.

help: resources/lang/en/help.php and resources/lang/bg/help.php updated where needed
