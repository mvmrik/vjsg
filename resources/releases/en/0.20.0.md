# Version 0.20.0

Date: 2025-11-06

## What's new

- Cached building-level aggregates: the server now maintains per-user cached totals for each object type (houses, banks, hospitals, etc.). This reduces load and allows faster daily jobs and UI queries.
- Banks now reduce market fees: bank upgrades and tools decrease your market fee; the system updates fees immediately after bank changes.
- Market fees and order safety: new orders will be blocked if your account cannot cover the potential taker fee for that order — this prevents accidental negative balances from fees.

Help: the in-game Help pages were updated with short notes about cached aggregates, market fees and order placement behavior.
