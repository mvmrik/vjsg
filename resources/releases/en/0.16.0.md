# Version 0.16.0

## What's new

- Market (player marketplace): you can now place buy and sell orders for tools/products directly from the game UI. Orders are matched in periodic batches to keep the system fair and performant.
- Simple price chart, order book and recent trades view added to the Market page.
- Basic anti-cheat and reserve mechanics: funds and sold items are reserved when an order is placed; trades settle atomically when matched.
- Help pages updated with short guidance about how the Market works.

Help: help pages updated for both English and Bulgarian to explain the Market basics and reservation behavior.
