# v0.18.0

Date: 2025-11-01

Improved parcel editor and construction UX

- Modernized the Parcel Editor / Build modal with a card-based layout for easier object selection.
- Required materials are now shown per building (required / available) with clear translated names.
- Build/Upgrade actions are validated: the Confirm button is disabled when you don't have enough materials or haven't assigned workers.
- Starting a build or upgrade now consumes the required resources from your inventory (server-side validation and deduction).
- Visual cues: selected object highlighting, insufficient-material warnings, and nicer build-time display.
- Translations added/updated for the above UI strings (English & Bulgarian).
- Help pages updated to note the Market UI Actions column and "hide cancelled" persistence where applicable.

Help: help pages were updated where relevant to reflect UI changes.
