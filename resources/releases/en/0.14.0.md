## What's new

- Instant communal Lottery: players can now play immediately and receive a server-side draw at the moment they press Play. Each bet is added to a shared jackpot and payouts are calculated as percentages of the current jackpot (6 matches = 100%, 5 = 20%, 4 = 4%, 3 = 1% with minimum payout). The jackpot is decreased immediately when payouts are awarded.
- Improved UX: animation remains for suspense, but results and payouts are recorded atomically on the server so subsequent players see the updated jackpot.
- Jackpot consistency checks: the client warns if the jackpot decreased since you saw it, and the server rejects stale bets to avoid surprises.
- Minor UI and translation fixes for the Lottery page.

Help: help pages updated to explain the new Lottery behavior.
