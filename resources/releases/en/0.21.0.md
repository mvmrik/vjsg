## Workshop System & Tool Decay

This update introduces a new building type and tool maintenance mechanics to create a more dynamic economy:

- **New Building: Workshop** — A new buildable structure that extends the lifespan of your tools
- **Tool Decay System** — All installed tools now wear out daily based on your workshop levels:
  - Without workshops: tools last only **1 day** (100% decay per day)
  - With workshops: each level reduces decay by 0.99%, up to 100 levels for **1% decay** (100-day lifespan)
- **Decay Timing** — Tool decay happens AFTER daily population calculations, ensuring tools are counted before wearing out
- **Statistics UI** — New "Tools Decay Rate" indicator shows your current decay percentage and tool lifespan
- **Translations** — Added Bulgarian translations for "Bank" and "Workshop" building names
- **Help Updated** — Help section now includes detailed information about workshop mechanics and tool decay

This system creates strategic decisions about resource allocation and encourages active tool production and trading.
