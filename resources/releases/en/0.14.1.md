# Version 0.14.1

Date: 2025-10-26

## What's changed

- Prevent players from losing their entire population in a single tick — immediate mortality is now capped at 80% of a player's population. This avoids accidental full wipeouts when hospital capacity is zero.
- The player-facing statistics (Settings → Stats) now display expected mortality capped at 80% to match the server behavior.
- Help pages updated (English and Bulgarian) to explain the new mortality cap so players know what to expect.

Help: help pages updated to explain the new behavior.
