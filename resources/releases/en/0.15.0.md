# Version 0.15.0

Date: 2025-10-30

## What's new

- Improved build-time display: build and upgrade times are now shown using human-friendly units (minutes, hours, days) in the parcel editor and upgrade dialogs for easier reading.
- UX polish: object palette and upgrade modal now show formatted times instead of raw minute values (e.g. "15h 1m" or "3d 11h").

Help: the in-game help pages were updated to explain the new time-format display.

No gameplay mechanics were changed â€” this release focuses on UI clarity and readability.
