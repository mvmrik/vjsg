# Version 0.17.1

Date: 2025-11-01

Small bugfix release — user-facing improvements:

- The Market UI now shows a dedicated Actions column with a compact cancel (trash) icon for your orders. The cancel button is always in the same place for easier use.
- The "Hide cancelled" setting on the Market page is now remembered between visits — when checked, cancelled orders stay hidden after reload.
- Various small UX fixes to make placing and cancelling market orders clearer. Help pages updated with brief notes about the Market UI.

Help: updated
